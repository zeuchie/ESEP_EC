# Project Overview
This project implements an in-memory database with transaction support in C++. The database supports basic operations like get and put, with the ability to manage transactions through begin_transaction, commit, and rollback operations.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler with C++17 support
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## Building and Running
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 InMemoryDB.cpp -o InMemoryDB
```

2. Run the executable:
```bash
./InMemoryDB
```
The program includes a main function that demonstrates all the required functionality through various test cases.

## Suggestions to Improve This Assignment
1. Offer more guidance on how to implement the assignment to help students get started.
2. Provide additional tests and edge cases to ensure implementations are correct.
3. Create a mock repository with starter code to help students understand the assignment requirements.
